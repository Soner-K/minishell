1. Redo the delete_whitespace function, so that instead of creating a whole new list
I can just point to the already existing list and delete the whitespaces.

2. Handle cases where first node is a separator in get_cmd function

3. Implement simple redirections (infile, outfile) in the do_pipe function

4. Move the head of the token's list after each turn in the main process but cleaner

5. Check for leaks

6. Error message for is_valid_operator

7. Think about $? (new type?)

8. Check_if_cmd : gerer malloc failure (fct d'erreur)

9. Add an error code variable in the structure ?

10 Do a map of all the function called, to check where to protect for NULL and where it isnt needed.

11. First do the expand, and then the redirections.
