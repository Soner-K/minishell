HANDLE MULTIPLE EXPAND INSIDE ONE WORD + IF A $ IS INSIDE AN EXPANSION

1. Redo the delete_whitespace function, so that instead of creating a whole new list
I can just point to the already existing list and delete the whitespaces.

2. Handle cases where first node is a separator in get_cmd function

3. Implement simple redirections (infile, outfile) in the do_pipe function

4. Move the head of the token's list after each turn in the main process but cleaner

5. Check for leaks

6. Error message for is_valid_operator

7. Think about $? (new type?)

8. Check_if_cmd : gerer malloc failure (fct d'erreur)

9. Add an error code variable in the structure ?

10 Do a map of all the function called, to check where to protect for NULL and where it isnt needed.

11. First do the expand, and then the redirections.

12. Handle unclosed quotes errors

13. Check if head parameters of tokens list is adjusted after head is moved.
Is there a need to keep the head parameter ?

14. Which order (quotes removal, redirection syntax and grammar, expand) ?
