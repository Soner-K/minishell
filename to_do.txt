1. Redo the delete_whitespace function, so that instead of creating a whole new list
I can just point to the already existing list and delete the whitespaces.

2. Handle cases where first node is a separator in get_cmd function

3. Implement simple redirections (infile, outfile) in the do_pipe function

4. Move the head of the token's list after each turn in the main process but cleaner

5. Check for leaks
